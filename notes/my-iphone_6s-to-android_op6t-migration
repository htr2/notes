backup iphone with itunes (need local file for data extract)

google app migration (pics&vids, calendar, contacts)
https://www.android.com/switch/
setup google account if you dont have one yet...
install gdrive on iphone, backup everything
switch on new phone and import backup....
(oneplus switch app is an alternative for the same data+audio but fairly new for ios)
as i was already using gmail for mail no further considerations for mail migration....

install all apps on new phone (identify replacement apps if required)
check login for all the apps work ....(keepass helps and is available for many platforms)

more thoughts required:

audio (music, ringtones, etc)
plud android into pc, use explorer to copy files from itune library (usually C:\Users\<username>\Music\iTunes\iTunes Media\Music) to <android phone>\Internal Storage\Music

lire rss reader -> flym
iphone lire export opml, save to gdrive, flym import opml

corporate rsa secureid, outlook etc
follow corporate instructions for new setup...

google authenticator
only assistance available is 2fa migration for google.....
this means for all other tokens: login to each service, delete existing 2fa and re-establish with new authenticator on android

whatsapp
(ios backsup to icloud, android to google, no idea why FB does not want to provide a cross platform export/import)
ios export individual chats with media to gdrive 
 -will give a zip file per chat containig txt transcript and media files, ie no import in android whatsapp
 -for chats with a lot of media this will require to set ios auto-lock to never. usually corporate managed devices will have a profile preventing this  ->unmanage device by deleting profile)
sms method below might be an alternative?

books
i didnt have many but some i wanted to keep, exported via email (sms method below might be an alternative)
alternatively copy from itunes library (usually C:\Users\<username>\Music\iTunes\iTunes Media\Books)

sms
use local itunes backup folder (found mine in C:\Users\<username>\Apple\MobileSync\Backup\<id>)
find file with sms data: 3d0d7e5fb2ce288813306e4d4636395e047a3d28
open with sqllite browser and use sql script below (plenty of others on the net)
export to csv file
